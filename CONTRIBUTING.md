# How to contribute to LBTDS

First of all, thank you for your interest in our humble project. We hope you enjoy it.

## Development isn't on Github

All pull requests and issues should be placed [here](https://lab.wtfteam.pro/wtfteam/lbtds/issues). Our repository in Github is just a mirror â€” you can post issues and PRs there, but we will need to move it manually to our server because of mirroring and this could (or **WILL**) take time. It's better to file them at <https://lab.wtfteam.pro/wtfteam/lbtds>.

The reason why this was done exactly like that is to be sure that if something happens with Github our applications and libraries will be still available and vice versa. It's always good to have more than one sources storage.

You can login to our Gitea instance on [lab.wtfteam.pro](https://lab.wtfteam.pro) using your existing account on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket.

## The Rules

There will be more general contributing rules in the future. For now, there are simply three requirements:

* Be nice to people
* Use gofmt/golangci-lint
* Don't panic (as a human and as a ``panic()`` function)

## The License

All code is licensed under MIT, and you should accept this license before submitting any code here.
