# LBTDS â€” Load Balancer That Don't Suck

At least we hope so.

## Our goals

Our goals is to provide as tiny as possible load balancer, compatible with "blue-green" deployment paradigm. Unlinke some other of load balancers, we have these features:

* Simple configuration
* Support for more than two colors (we support any color you want)
* Small run-time and binary size.

## Current status

This software is under development and in early stages. Some things may break.
