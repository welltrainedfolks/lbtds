# How to contribute to LBTDS

First of all, thank you for your interest in our humble project. We hope you enjoy it.

All pull requests and issues can be placed [here](https://source.hodakov.me/fat0troll/lbtds). Our repository in Github is just a mirror â€” you can post issues and PRs there, but we will need to move it manually to our server because of mirroring.

There will be more general contributing rules in the future. For now, there are simply three requirements:

* Be nice to people
* Use gofmt/golangci-lint
* Don't panic (as a human and as a ``panic()`` function)

All code is licensed under MIT, and you should accept this license before submitting any code here.
